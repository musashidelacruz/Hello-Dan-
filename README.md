# Hello-Dan-
Musashi Learning github. Or Git?: I don't know what I don't know
This is the read me file that will tell about this project.  This line was edited on GitHub itself.

This repository is not actually a project but simply to learn how Git works.  

This is called "Hello Dan" because it is my first attempt to speak to Dan through GitHub, which is not the same as Git, a verion control system created by the Linux kernal person. Some people use Git but store their directories on an independently hosted server.  There is also something call GitKrakan, which is interested.  The GitHub cat mascot has a tentical instead of a tail.
